University Webpage Design Project
This project is a demonstration of a fabricated university's webpage, 
created as part of a group exercise for my course at MITT. The focus 
was on building a responsive design while incorporating various web 
components and formatting techniques.

Please refer to the acknowledgments section for details on my project partners.

Note: As I am currently managing several 
other projects, this webapp is a work in progress.  Further adjustments 
and expansions to the design will be implemented in the near future.
