# Cedar University

Example of a University Webpage design, using a fabricated University and history. 
This was a group project for my course at MITT, as an exercise in responsive design and formatting numerous components. Please see acknowledgements for my project partners details. 

This is still a work in progress. My attention is currently spread over several projects, but I intend to adjust the current design as well as expand on the overall design.
